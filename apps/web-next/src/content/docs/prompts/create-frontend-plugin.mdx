## When to Use This

Use this prompt when you want to build a **UI-only plugin** that:

- Displays information or dashboards
- Interacts with external APIs (via the shell's API proxy)
- Doesn't need its own backend server or database
- Is the simplest type of plugin to start with

## The Prompt

Copy the entire block below and paste it into your AI assistant:

```markdown
# Task: Create a NaaP Frontend-Only Plugin

## Context: NaaP Platform

NaaP (Network as a Platform) is a plugin-based platform. Plugins are built as
React applications bundled in UMD format and loaded into a shell application.

Key technical details:
- Frontend: React 18+, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Vite
- Bundle format: UMD (via vite.config.ts using createPluginConfig)
- Shell integration: @naap/plugin-sdk provides hooks and components
- The shell handles authentication, theming, notifications, and routing

Available SDK hooks (import from @naap/plugin-sdk):
- useAuth() → { user, token, hasRole(role), hasPermission(perm) }
- useNotify() → { success(msg), error(msg), warning(msg), info(msg) }
- usePluginApi() → { get(url), post(url, data), put(url, data), delete(url) }
- useThemeService() → { theme, isDark }
- useEvents() → { emit(event, data), on(event, callback), off(event, callback) }
- usePluginContext() → { pluginId, teamId, config }

Mount function pattern (frontend/src/mount.tsx):
```tsx
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';
import { ShellProvider } from '@naap/plugin-sdk';
import App from './App';

export function mount(container: HTMLElement, shellContext: any) {
  const root = createRoot(container);
  root.render(
    <ShellProvider context={shellContext}>
      <App />
    </ShellProvider>
  );
  return () => root.unmount();
}
```

## Requirements

Create a frontend-only NaaP plugin called "[YOUR_PLUGIN_NAME]" that does:

[DESCRIBE WHAT YOUR PLUGIN SHOULD DO HERE — for example:
- "A bookmark manager that lets users save and organize links"
- "A weather dashboard that shows current weather for cities"
- "A Pomodoro timer with task tracking"
- "A team announcement board"
]

## Technical Specifications

1. Generate a complete plugin.json manifest:
   ```json
   {
     "name": "[plugin-name]",
     "displayName": "[Plugin Display Name]",
     "version": "1.0.0",
     "description": "[description]",
     "category": "[pick: analytics|communication|developer-tools|finance|infrastructure|monitoring|other]",
     "author": { "name": "[Your Name]" },
     "frontend": {
       "entry": "production/[plugin-name].js",
       "routes": [{ "path": "/[plugin-name]", "component": "App" }],
       "navigation": {
         "label": "[Display Name]",
         "icon": "[lucide-icon-name]",
         "order": 50
       }
     },
     "permissions": ["read:profile"]
   }
   ```

2. Generate the full file structure:
   ```
   [plugin-name]/
   ├── plugin.json
   ├── frontend/
   │   ├── package.json        (react, @naap/plugin-sdk, tailwindcss, vite deps)
   │   ├── tsconfig.json
   │   ├── vite.config.ts       (UMD build config via createPluginConfig)
   │   ├── src/
   │   │   ├── App.tsx          (main component with routing/layout)
   │   │   ├── mount.tsx        (shell mount function)
   │   │   └── components/      (reusable UI components)
   │   └── index.html
   ```

3. Use Tailwind CSS for all styling. Make the UI look professional and modern.
4. Use the useAuth() hook to show user-specific content.
5. Use the useNotify() hook for success/error feedback.
6. Use the usePluginApi() hook if the plugin needs to fetch external data.
7. Include proper loading states, error handling, and empty states.
8. Make the UI responsive (mobile + desktop).

## Quality Standards

- All TypeScript — no `any` types
- Components are modular and reusable
- Include helpful code comments
- Follow React best practices (proper state management, effect cleanup)
- Handle edge cases (loading, errors, empty data)

Generate ALL files with complete, working code. Do not use placeholders.
```

## How to Customize

Before pasting, replace these sections:

1. **`[YOUR_PLUGIN_NAME]`** — your plugin's name (e.g., `bookmark-manager`)
2. **`[DESCRIBE WHAT YOUR PLUGIN SHOULD DO]`** — write 2-3 sentences about what the plugin does
3. **`[Your Name]`** — your name for the author field

## After the AI Generates Code

```bash
# 1. Create the plugin directory
naap-plugin create my-plugin --template frontend-only

# 2. Replace the generated files with the AI's output
# (copy each file the AI generated into the right location)

# 3. Install dependencies
cd my-plugin/frontend
npm install

# 4. Start the dev server
naap-plugin dev

# 5. Open http://localhost:3000 — your plugin appears in the sidebar
```

## Example: Bookmark Manager

Here's a filled-in version of the requirements section:

```markdown
Create a frontend-only NaaP plugin called "bookmark-manager" that does:

- Lets users save URLs with a title, description, and tags
- Organizes bookmarks into folders/categories
- Has a search bar to filter bookmarks by title or tag
- Shows a grid view and a list view (toggle between them)
- Uses localStorage to persist bookmarks (no backend needed)
- Has an "import/export" feature to backup bookmarks as JSON
- Shows a count of total bookmarks and most-used tags
```

## Follow-Up Prompts

After the initial plugin is generated, you can refine it:

```markdown
# Add drag-and-drop reordering to the bookmark list
# Use react-beautiful-dnd or a similar library

Add drag-and-drop functionality so users can reorder their bookmarks
by dragging them. Keep the existing grid/list toggle working.
```

```markdown
# Make the UI more polished
Improve the visual design of the bookmark manager:
- Add subtle animations when adding/removing bookmarks
- Use a card-based layout with hover effects
- Add a dark mode that follows the shell theme (useThemeService)
- Add favicon previews for each bookmarked URL
```
