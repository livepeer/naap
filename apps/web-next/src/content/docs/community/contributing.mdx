## Overview

NaaP is an open platform and we welcome contributions from the community. Whether you're fixing bugs, adding features, improving documentation, or building plugins, there are many ways to get involved.

## Ways to Contribute

### Build Plugins

The most impactful way to contribute is by building plugins that extend the platform's functionality. See the [Plugin Development Guide](/docs/guides/your-first-plugin) to get started.

### Report Issues

Found a bug? Open an issue on GitHub with:

1. A clear title and description
2. Steps to reproduce the issue
3. Expected vs. actual behavior
4. Your environment (OS, Node version, browser)

### Improve Documentation

Documentation improvements are always welcome:

1. Fix typos and clarify wording
2. Add missing examples
3. Update outdated information
4. Translate docs to other languages

### Submit Code

For bug fixes and features:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/my-change`
3. Make your changes
4. Write tests for new functionality
5. Run the test suite: `npm test`
6. Submit a pull request
