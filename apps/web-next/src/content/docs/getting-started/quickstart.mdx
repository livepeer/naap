## One-Line Setup

From a fresh clone to a fully running platform with a single command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/livepeer/naap.git && cd naap && ./bin/setup.sh --start
```

This command handles everything automatically:

1. Checks and installs dependencies (`npm install`)
2. Starts a PostgreSQL database via Docker
3. Creates all database schemas (public + 7 plugin schemas)
4. Auto-generates all `.env` files with development defaults
5. Seeds the database with initial data
6. Builds all 11 plugin UMD bundles
7. Starts the full platform (shell + core services)

Open **http://localhost:3000** when setup completes.

## Already Set Up?

```bash
# Shell + core only (fastest startup, ~20s)
./bin/start.sh

# Everything including all plugin backends
./bin/start.sh start --all

# Develop a specific plugin with hot reload
./bin/start.sh dev my-dashboard
```

## Verify Everything Works

```bash
./bin/start.sh validate
```

You should see:

```
=== Core Services ===
  [PASS] Base Service
  [PASS] Plugin Server
  [PASS] Shell

=== Plugin Assets (CDN) ===
  [PASS] Capacity Planner CDN bundle
  [PASS] Community Hub CDN bundle
  ... (all 11 plugins)

=== Unified Database Schemas ===
  [PASS] Schema public (67 tables)
  [PASS] Schema plugin_community (exists)
  ... (all 7 plugin schemas)

Results: 38 passed, 0 failed
```

## Stop & Restart

```bash
# Graceful shutdown of all services
./bin/start.sh stop

# Restart (stop + start)
./bin/start.sh restart

# Live status dashboard (auto-refreshes)
./bin/start.sh watch
```

## Development URLs

| Service | URL | Description |
|---------|-----|-------------|
| Shell | http://localhost:3000 | Main application |
| Base Service | http://localhost:4000/healthz | Core API |
| Plugin Server | http://localhost:3100/plugins | Plugin asset server |

Plugin backends run on ports 4001-4012. Run `./bin/start.sh status` for the full list.
