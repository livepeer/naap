## When to Use This

Use these prompts when:

- Your plugin won't start or shows errors
- Something used to work but broke after a change
- You see error messages you don't understand
- Your plugin loads but doesn't behave correctly
- Build or compilation errors

## Prompt: General Debugging

```markdown
# Task: Debug My NaaP Plugin

## The Problem

[DESCRIBE WHAT'S HAPPENING — for example:
- "My plugin shows a blank white screen when I open it"
- "The API call returns a 500 error"
- "The page loads but the data doesn't appear"
- "I get a TypeScript error when building"
]

## Error Messages

[PASTE ANY ERROR MESSAGES YOU SEE — check:
- Browser console (right-click → Inspect → Console tab)
- Terminal where you ran `naap-plugin dev`
- The browser's Network tab for failed API calls
]

```
[PASTE ERROR OUTPUT HERE]
```

## What I Expected

[DESCRIBE WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN]

## What I Changed Recently

[LIST ANY RECENT CHANGES — for example:
- "I added a new component called TaskList.tsx"
- "I changed the Prisma schema and ran prisma db push"
- "I installed a new npm package"
- "I didn't change anything, it just stopped working"
]

## Relevant Code

[PASTE THE CODE YOU THINK IS CAUSING THE ISSUE — include the full file if it's small]

## My Environment

- Node.js version: [run `node --version`]
- Running on: [Mac / Windows / Linux]
- Browser: [Chrome / Firefox / Safari]

## Please:

1. Explain what's causing the error in simple terms
2. Show me exactly which lines to change to fix it
3. Explain why the fix works
4. Tell me how to prevent this issue in the future
```

## Prompt: Fix Common Errors

### Plugin Won't Load in Shell

```markdown
# My NaaP Plugin Won't Load

The plugin doesn't appear in the shell sidebar, or it shows "Failed to load plugin."

Here's my plugin.json:
[PASTE YOUR plugin.json]

Here's my mount.tsx:
[PASTE YOUR mount.tsx]

Here's my vite.config.ts:
[PASTE YOUR vite.config.ts]

Error in browser console:
[PASTE ANY ERRORS]

Please check:
1. Is plugin.json valid and has the correct structure?
2. Is the mount function exported correctly?
3. Is the Vite UMD config correct?
4. Are there any missing dependencies?
5. Is the frontend building successfully? (check terminal output)

Show me what to fix.
```

### API Calls Failing

```markdown
# My Plugin's API Calls Are Failing

When my frontend calls the backend API, I get errors.

Frontend code making the call:
[PASTE THE COMPONENT/HOOK MAKING THE API CALL]

Backend route handling the call:
[PASTE THE ROUTE HANDLER]

Error in browser Network tab:
- URL: [the failing URL]
- Status: [404 / 500 / CORS error / etc.]
- Response body: [paste the error response]

Error in backend terminal:
[PASTE ANY BACKEND ERRORS]

My plugin.json backend config:
```json
{
  "backend": {
    "port": [PORT],
    "apiPrefix": "/api/v1/[plugin-name]"
  }
}
```

Please diagnose and fix the issue.
```

### Database/Prisma Errors

```markdown
# Prisma Database Error in My NaaP Plugin

**Architecture context:** NaaP uses a single PostgreSQL database (`naap`) with
multi-schema isolation. All models are in `packages/database/prisma/schema.prisma`.
Plugins import from `@naap/database`, never from `@prisma/client` or local generated dirs.

I'm getting a database error in my plugin backend.

Error message:
```
[PASTE THE FULL PRISMA ERROR]
```

My models (from packages/database/prisma/schema.prisma):
[PASTE THE RELEVANT MODELS]

The code that triggers the error:
[PASTE THE CODE MAKING THE DATABASE QUERY]

What I was trying to do:
[DESCRIBE THE OPERATION]

Please:
1. Explain what the Prisma error means
2. Show me the fix
3. Show the corrected Prisma query or schema (with @@schema annotations)
4. Tell me if I need to run `cd packages/database && npx prisma generate && npx prisma db push`
5. Verify I'm importing from @naap/database (not @prisma/client)
```

### Build/TypeScript Errors

```markdown
# Build Errors in My NaaP Plugin

When I run `npm run build` or the dev server, I get TypeScript errors.

Error output:
```
[PASTE THE FULL ERROR OUTPUT]
```

The file with the error:
[PASTE THE FULL FILE CONTENT]

Please:
1. Explain each error in simple terms
2. Show me the corrected code
3. Explain the TypeScript concept behind each fix
```

## Quick Fix Reference

Before using AI, try these common fixes:

```bash
# Plugin not showing up? Restart the dev server
naap-plugin dev

# Dependencies missing? Reinstall
cd frontend && rm -rf node_modules && npm install
cd ../backend && rm -rf node_modules && npm install

# Database out of sync? Reset from the central package
cd packages/database
npx prisma generate
npx prisma db push --force-reset

# Port already in use?
lsof -ti:4050 | xargs kill -9

# TypeScript cache stale?
rm -rf dist tsconfig.tsbuildinfo
npm run build

# Everything broken? Nuclear option
rm -rf node_modules frontend/node_modules backend/node_modules
npm install
cd frontend && npm install
cd ../backend && npm install
npx prisma generate
```

## Tips for Better Debugging Prompts

1. **Always paste the full error message** — AI assistants are very good at diagnosing errors when they can see the exact output
2. **Include the relevant code** — paste the file that's causing the issue
3. **Describe what changed** — "it worked before I did X" is extremely helpful
4. **Include your environment** — Node.js version, OS, and browser matter
5. **Be specific** — "it doesn't work" is less helpful than "clicking the Save button shows a 500 error with message 'Cannot read property id of undefined'"
