## When to Use This

Use this prompt when:

- You have a working plugin but the UI looks basic
- You want to redesign a plugin's interface to be more professional
- You're starting fresh and want great design from the beginning
- You want to match a specific design style (dashboard, SaaS, minimal, etc.)

## The Prompt

```markdown
# Task: Design a Professional UI for a NaaP Plugin

## Context

I have a NaaP plugin that needs a professional, modern UI redesign.
The plugin runs inside the NaaP shell (a React dashboard application).

Technical stack:
- React 18+ with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Lucide React for icons (import { IconName } from 'lucide-react')
- The shell provides dark/light theme via useThemeService() hook
- The shell provides user info via useAuth() hook
- Available CSS variables from the shell theme:
  --background, --foreground, --card, --card-foreground, --primary,
  --primary-foreground, --secondary, --muted, --muted-foreground,
  --accent, --border, --ring, --destructive

## Current Plugin Description

[DESCRIBE YOUR PLUGIN AND ITS CURRENT STATE — for example:
- "A task tracker with a list of tasks, add/edit forms, and filters"
- "A dashboard showing network analytics with charts"
- "A settings page with forms for configuring integrations"
]

## Design Requirements

Redesign the UI with these principles:

1. **Layout**: Clean, spacious layout with proper visual hierarchy
   - Use a top section for page title, description, and primary actions
   - Main content area with clear sections
   - Use cards for grouping related content
   - Proper spacing (gap-4/6 between sections, p-4/6 for card padding)

2. **Typography**: Clear hierarchy
   - Page title: text-2xl or text-3xl, font-bold
   - Section headings: text-lg, font-semibold
   - Body text: text-sm, text-muted-foreground
   - Labels: text-xs, text-muted-foreground, uppercase tracking-wider

3. **Colors**: Use the shell's CSS variables
   - Primary actions: bg-primary text-primary-foreground
   - Secondary actions: border border-border hover:bg-muted
   - Cards: bg-card rounded-xl border border-border shadow-sm
   - Status badges: Colored with low opacity backgrounds
     (bg-emerald-500/10 text-emerald-500 for success, etc.)

4. **Interactive Elements**:
   - Buttons with hover/active states and transitions
   - Smooth transitions (transition-all duration-200)
   - Hover effects on cards and list items
   - Loading skeletons (animated pulse placeholders)
   - Empty states with illustrations or icons

5. **Responsive**: Works on mobile (sm:), tablet (md:), and desktop (lg:)

6. **Dark Mode**: Must work in both light and dark themes
   - Use Tailwind's dark: prefix where needed
   - Rely on CSS variables for automatic theme switching
   - Test contrast in both modes

7. **Data Display Patterns**:
   - Stats: Row of metric cards (icon + number + label + trend)
   - Tables: Rounded borders, striped rows, sticky headers
   - Lists: Cards with hover states, badges for status
   - Forms: Labeled inputs with helper text and validation states
   - Charts: Clean, minimal style with proper legends

## Components to Generate

Create these reusable components:

- PageHeader — title, description, action buttons
- StatsCard — icon, metric value, label, trend indicator
- DataTable — sortable columns, pagination, row actions
- StatusBadge — colored badge for different statuses
- EmptyState — icon, title, description, action button
- LoadingSkeleton — animated placeholder for each component
- SearchInput — search bar with icon and clear button
- FilterBar — filter chips/dropdowns

## Quality Standards

- All components must be TypeScript with proper types
- Each component in its own file in a components/ directory
- Use Tailwind CSS only (no inline styles, no CSS modules)
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Accessible (proper aria labels, keyboard navigation, focus states)
- Include a dark mode screenshot description in comments

Generate complete, production-ready component code.
```

## How to Customize

Replace:
1. **`[DESCRIBE YOUR PLUGIN]`** — describe what your plugin shows and does
2. Add or remove items from "Components to Generate" based on your needs
3. Add a "Design Reference" section if you want a specific style:

```markdown
## Design Reference

I want the UI to look similar to:
- Linear.app (minimal, clean, fast-feeling)
- Vercel Dashboard (dark, modern, metric-focused)
- Notion (content-first, spacious, neutral colors)
- Stripe Dashboard (data-rich, tables and charts)
```

## Follow-Up Prompts

### Add Animations

```markdown
Add smooth micro-animations to the plugin UI:
- Fade-in on page load (opacity 0 → 1 with slight upward motion)
- Staggered list items (each card fades in 50ms after the previous)
- Button press feedback (scale down slightly on click)
- Smooth tab transitions
- Loading spinner with the NaaP primary color
Use Tailwind's animation utilities and CSS transitions. No external animation libraries.
```

### Add Data Visualization

```markdown
Add beautiful data visualizations to the plugin:
- Use the recharts library (import { LineChart, BarChart, PieChart, ... } from 'recharts')
- Style charts to match the shell theme (use CSS variable colors)
- Add a chart wrapper component that handles loading/empty states
- Charts should be responsive and resize with the container
- Include tooltips on hover with formatted values
- Add a time range selector (7d, 30d, 90d, 1y)
```

### Redesign to Match a Specific App

```markdown
Redesign the plugin UI to look like [APP_NAME]. Specifically:
- Match their color palette and spacing
- Use their layout patterns (sidebar nav, content area, etc.)
- Copy their data display style (cards, tables, metrics)
- Match their button and form input styling
But keep using Tailwind CSS and the shell's theme CSS variables for
dark/light mode compatibility.
```
