## First-Time Setup

From a fresh clone to a fully running platform:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/livepeer/naap.git && cd naap && ./bin/start.sh
```

This handles everything automatically:

1. Installs dependencies (`npm install`)
2. Starts a PostgreSQL database via Docker
3. Creates all database schemas (public + plugin schemas)
4. Auto-generates all `.env` files with development defaults
5. Seeds the database with initial data
6. Builds all 12 plugin UMD bundles
7. Starts the full platform

Open **http://localhost:3000** when setup completes.

Setup runs automatically on first start.

## Daily Development (after first setup)

```bash
# Recommended daily driver (~6s)
./bin/start.sh                      # auto-detects your changed plugins

# Start a specific plugin (~6s)
./bin/start.sh community            # shell + community backend

# Start multiple plugins (~8s)
./bin/start.sh gateway-manager community

# Everything (~10s warm)
./bin/start.sh --all

# Stop (~2s)
./bin/stop.sh
```

### How smart start works

Smart start is designed for the typical developer who works on one
plugin at a time:

- Skips redundant DB sync and plugin verification
- Compares source hashes to detect which plugins you changed
- Rebuilds only the changed plugin(s)
- Starts shell + marketplace + your changed plugin backends
- If nothing changed, starts shell only

**Result: 6-8 second startup, every time.**

## Verify Everything Works

```bash
./bin/start.sh validate
```

This runs a full health check across all services, CDN bundles, and database schemas.

## Stop & Restart

```bash
./bin/stop.sh                       # parallel stop (~2s)
./bin/start.sh restart              # stop + start
./bin/start.sh watch                # live dashboard (auto-refreshes)
```

## Add `--timing` to see where time goes

```bash
./bin/start.sh --all --timing
#   Infrastructure    1s
#   Plugin builds     0s  (all cached)
#   Core services     3s
#   Shell + backends  2s
#   Verification      1s
#   TOTAL             7s
```

## Development URLs

| Service | URL | Description |
|---------|-----|-------------|
| Shell | http://localhost:3000 | Main application |
| Base Service | http://localhost:4000/healthz | Core API |
| Plugin Server | http://localhost:3100/plugins | Plugin asset server |

Plugin backends run on ports 4001-4012. Run `./bin/start.sh status` for the full list.
