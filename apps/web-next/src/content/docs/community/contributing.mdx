## Overview

NaaP is an open platform and we welcome contributions from the community. Whether you're fixing bugs, adding features, improving documentation, or building plugins, there are many ways to get involved.

> **New to NaaP?** Read the [Development Process](/docs/guides/development-process) guide for the full branch strategy, PR workflow, and team-specific guidance.

## Ways to Contribute

### Build Plugins

The most impactful way to contribute is by building plugins that extend the platform's functionality. See the [Plugin Development Guide](/docs/guides/your-first-plugin) to get started, then follow the [Development Process](/docs/guides/development-process#for-plugin-teams) for how to set up your team's workflow.

### Report Issues

Found a bug? Open an issue on GitHub with:

1. A clear title and description
2. Steps to reproduce the issue
3. Expected vs. actual behavior
4. Your environment (OS, Node version, browser)

### Improve Documentation

Documentation improvements are always welcome:

1. Fix typos and clarify wording
2. Add missing examples
3. Update outdated information
4. Translate docs to other languages

### Submit Code

For bug fixes and features:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch following the naming convention: `feat/<team>/<description>`
3. Make your changes following [Conventional Commits](/docs/guides/development-process#commit-conventions)
4. Write tests for new functionality
5. Run the test suite: `npm test`
6. Open a PR against `main`

See the full [PR process](/docs/guides/development-process#pr-process--step-by-step) for details.

## Development Setup

```bash
# Fork on GitHub, then clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/NaaP.git
cd NaaP

# Add upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/livepeer/naap.git

# First-time setup (installs deps, starts DB, builds plugins, starts platform)
./bin/setup.sh --start

# Daily development (after first setup):
./bin/start.sh --fast            # smart start (~6s): auto-detects changed plugins
./bin/start.sh community         # shell + one plugin (~6s)
./bin/start.sh start --all       # all plugins (~10s warm)
./bin/start.sh stop              # parallel stop (~2s)

# Login at http://localhost:3000
# Email: admin@livepeer.org  Password: livepeer
```

## Code Style

- **TypeScript**: All code should be written in TypeScript with strict mode
- **ESLint**: Follow the project's ESLint configuration
- **Prettier**: Format code with Prettier before committing
- **Naming**: Use camelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for components/types
- **Comments**: Write JSDoc comments for public APIs

## Pull Request Guidelines

1. **Target `main`**: All PRs target `main` directly. Vercel PR previews serve as staging
2. **Keep PRs focused**: One feature or fix per PR, under 400 lines when possible
3. **Use Conventional Commits**: `feat(plugin/name): add feature`
4. **Write tests**: Include unit tests for new functionality
5. **Update docs**: Update documentation if your change affects the public API
6. **Follow conventions**: Match the existing code style
7. **Describe your changes**: Write a clear PR description

## Community Guidelines

- Be respectful and inclusive
- Provide constructive feedback
- Help newcomers get started
- Share knowledge and best practices

## Getting Help

- **GitHub Discussions**: Ask questions and share ideas
- **GitHub Issues**: Report bugs and request features
- **Documentation**: Browse these docs for answers
- **[Development Process](/docs/guides/development-process)**: Full guide for plugin teams and core contributors
