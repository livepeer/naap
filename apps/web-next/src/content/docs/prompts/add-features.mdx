## When to Use This

Use these prompts when you already have a working plugin and want to:

- Add a new page, tab, or view
- Add search, filtering, or sorting
- Integrate with an external API
- Add user preferences or settings
- Improve the existing functionality

## Prompt: Add a New Feature

```markdown
# Task: Add a New Feature to My NaaP Plugin

## Context

I have an existing NaaP plugin with the following structure:

Plugin name: [YOUR_PLUGIN_NAME]
Plugin type: [frontend-only / full-stack]

Current features:
[LIST WHAT YOUR PLUGIN CURRENTLY DOES — for example:
- Displays a list of items in a card grid
- Has a form to create new items
- Supports filtering by category
]

Current file structure:
[PASTE YOUR FILE STRUCTURE — you can get this by running: find . -type f -name "*.tsx" -o -name "*.ts" | head -30]

Technology stack:
- Frontend: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, @naap/plugin-sdk
- Backend (if full-stack): Express, Prisma, PostgreSQL

SDK hooks being used:
- useAuth() for user info
- useNotify() for notifications
- usePluginApi() for API calls
[ADJUST BASED ON WHAT YOUR PLUGIN USES]

## New Feature to Add

[DESCRIBE THE FEATURE YOU WANT — for example:
- "Add a search bar that filters items by title and description in real-time"
- "Add a settings page where users can customize their dashboard layout"
- "Add keyboard shortcuts (Cmd+K for search, Cmd+N for new item)"
- "Add a sidebar with bookmarks and recent items"
- "Add CSV export for all data"
]

## Requirements

1. Modify only the files that need changing. Show the full updated file content.
2. If new files are needed, provide complete code for each one.
3. Keep the existing functionality working — don't break anything.
4. Match the existing code style and patterns.
5. Use the same Tailwind CSS approach as the existing code.
6. Add proper TypeScript types for any new data structures.
7. Include loading states, error handling, and edge cases.

## Quality Standards

- No `any` types
- Reusable components where possible
- Helpful comments on complex logic
- Proper cleanup in useEffect hooks
- Accessible UI (keyboard nav, aria labels)

Tell me exactly which files to modify and which to create.
```

## Prompt: Add Search and Filtering

A ready-to-use prompt for one of the most common features:

```markdown
# Task: Add Search and Filtering to My NaaP Plugin

## Context

My NaaP plugin "[PLUGIN_NAME]" displays a list/grid of items.
I want to add powerful search and filtering capabilities.

Current data structure:
[DESCRIBE OR PASTE YOUR DATA TYPE — for example:
```typescript
interface Item {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  category: string;
  status: 'active' | 'archived';
  createdAt: string;
}
```
]

## Feature Requirements

1. **Search bar**
   - Full-text search across title and description
   - Debounced input (300ms delay before filtering)
   - Clear button to reset search
   - Show result count ("12 results" or "No results found")
   - Keyboard shortcut: Cmd+K or Ctrl+K to focus search

2. **Filter chips**
   - Filter by category (show all categories as toggleable chips)
   - Filter by status (active, archived, all)
   - Combine search + filters (AND logic)
   - Show active filter count
   - "Clear all filters" button

3. **Sort options**
   - Sort by: newest, oldest, alphabetical, most popular
   - Dropdown or segmented control for sort selection
   - Remember last selected sort in localStorage

4. **Results display**
   - Highlight matching text in search results
   - Show empty state when no results match
   - Animate items in/out when filters change
   - Show filter summary: "Showing 12 of 48 items"

Match the existing plugin's Tailwind CSS styling.
Generate all modified and new files with complete code.
```

## Prompt: Add User Settings / Preferences

```markdown
# Task: Add a Settings/Preferences Panel to My NaaP Plugin

## Context

My NaaP plugin "[PLUGIN_NAME]" needs a settings panel where users can
customize their experience. The plugin runs inside the NaaP shell.

## Settings to Include

[CHOOSE AND CUSTOMIZE FROM THESE OPTIONS:]

1. **Display preferences**
   - View mode: grid vs list vs table
   - Items per page: 10, 25, 50, 100
   - Default sort order
   - Compact vs comfortable spacing

2. **Notification preferences**
   - Enable/disable specific notification types
   - Notification frequency (instant, daily digest, weekly)

3. **Data preferences**
   - Default category filter
   - Date format (US, EU, ISO)
   - Number format (1,000 vs 1.000)

## Technical Requirements

1. Store settings in localStorage using a key like "[plugin-name]:settings"
2. Create a useSettings() custom hook that:
   - Returns current settings
   - Provides an updateSetting(key, value) function
   - Auto-saves to localStorage on change
   - Provides defaults for first-time users
3. Settings panel design:
   - Slide-over panel or modal (not a separate page)
   - Grouped sections with clear labels
   - Toggle switches for boolean settings
   - Dropdown selects for choice settings
   - "Reset to defaults" button
   - Changes apply immediately (no save button needed)
4. Use the shell theme for styling (Tailwind CSS, CSS variables)

Generate the useSettings hook, Settings panel component, and show how to
integrate them into the existing plugin code.
```

## Prompt: Add External API Integration

```markdown
# Task: Integrate an External API into My NaaP Plugin

## Context

My NaaP plugin needs to fetch data from an external API and display it.
The plugin uses @naap/plugin-sdk's usePluginApi() hook which proxies
requests through the shell's API gateway.

## API to Integrate

API: [NAME OR URL — for example: "OpenWeatherMap API", "GitHub API", "a REST API at https://api.example.com"]

Endpoints I need:
[LIST THE ENDPOINTS — for example:
- GET /weather?city={city} → returns { temp, humidity, description }
- GET /forecast?city={city}&days=5 → returns array of daily forecasts
]

Authentication: [None / API key in header / Bearer token]

## Requirements

1. Create a custom hook for the API (e.g., useWeatherApi):
   - Handles loading, error, and data states
   - Caches responses to avoid redundant requests
   - Auto-refreshes on a configurable interval (if applicable)
   - Provides retry functionality on error

2. Display the data in a beautiful UI:
   - Cards or dashboard layout
   - Loading skeletons while fetching
   - Error state with retry button
   - Empty state with helpful message
   - Auto-refresh indicator if applicable

3. If the API requires a key, add a setup screen:
   - Prompt user for their API key on first use
   - Store securely in localStorage
   - "Change API key" option in settings
   - Validate the key with a test request

Use Tailwind CSS, match the shell theme, include TypeScript types.
Generate all files with complete code.
```

## Tips for Writing Feature Prompts

When asking the AI to add features, always include:

1. **What the plugin currently does** — so the AI knows the context
2. **The current file structure** — paste output of `find . -name "*.tsx" -o -name "*.ts"`
3. **The existing code style** — paste a small section of existing code as reference
4. **What you want added** — be as specific as possible
5. **What NOT to break** — mention features that must keep working
