## Overview

**NaaP (Network as a Platform)** is a production-ready micro-frontend platform for building decentralized infrastructure management tools. It provides a shared shell application with a rich plugin system that allows teams to build, deploy, and manage independent features as plugins.

NaaP was originally built for the **Livepeer Network** -- a decentralized video and AI infrastructure network -- but its architecture is generic enough to power any plugin-based platform.

## Why NaaP?

### The Problem

Building a complex management dashboard for a decentralized network involves many independent features:

- Gateway monitoring and management
- Orchestrator management
- Capacity planning and scaling
- Network analytics
- Token treasury and governance
- Community forums
- A marketplace for extensions

Each feature needs its own UI, backend API, and database. Without a framework, teams end up with a monolithic application that becomes increasingly difficult to maintain, test, and deploy.

### The Solution

NaaP provides:

- **Shell Application**: A shared host app with authentication, navigation, theming, and services
- **Plugin System**: Independent micro-frontends loaded dynamically at runtime
- **Shared SDK**: Hooks and utilities that give plugins access to shell services
- **Backend Integration**: Each plugin can have its own Express backend and PostgreSQL database
- **Multi-Tenancy**: User and team contexts with isolated configurations

## Key Features

### Plugin Architecture
Build features as independent plugins with their own frontend, backend, and database. Plugins are loaded dynamically and communicate through a shared event bus.

### Shared Services
Plugins get access to authentication, notifications, theming, integrations (AI, storage, email), and more through the SDK.

### Multi-Tenant
Support for teams and organizations. Each team can have its own plugin configurations and data isolation.

### Production Ready
Built with Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. Deployable to Vercel with edge functions and serverless APIs.

### Developer Experience
CLI tooling for scaffolding, development, testing, and publishing plugins. Hot reload, automatic registration, and comprehensive documentation.

## Who Is It For?

- **Plugin Developers**: Build features for the NaaP ecosystem
- **Platform Engineers**: Extend the shell with new services and integrations
- **Network Operators**: Use plugins to manage infrastructure
- **Community Contributors**: Publish plugins to the marketplace
