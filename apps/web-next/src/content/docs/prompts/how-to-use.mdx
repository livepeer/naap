## What Are These Prompt Templates?

These prompt templates are **pre-written instructions** you copy and paste into an AI coding assistant. The AI will generate a complete, working NaaP plugin for you — including frontend UI, backend API, database schema, and configuration.

You don't need to know how to code. You just need to:

1. **Pick a prompt** that matches what you want to build
2. **Copy it** (use the Copy button on each code block)
3. **Paste it** into your AI assistant
4. **Follow the AI's instructions** to run the generated code

## Which AI Tools Work?

These prompts are designed to work with any AI coding assistant:

| Tool | Best For | How to Use |
|------|----------|------------|
| **Cursor** | Full IDE with AI built-in | Paste prompt in Composer (Cmd+I) |
| **GitHub Copilot** | VS Code integration | Paste in Copilot Chat panel |
| **ChatGPT** (GPT-4o) | General purpose | Paste in chat, copy code to files |
| **Claude** | Detailed code generation | Paste in chat, copy code to files |
| **Windsurf** | AI-native IDE | Paste in Cascade |
| **Bolt.new** | Browser-based dev | Paste as project prompt |

## Recommended Workflow

### Option A: Using Cursor (Easiest)

Cursor is an AI-powered code editor. It can create files, run commands, and test code for you.

```bash
# 1. Install Cursor from https://cursor.com
# 2. Open your NaaP project folder in Cursor
# 3. Press Cmd+I (Mac) or Ctrl+I (Windows) to open Composer
# 4. Paste the prompt template
# 5. Cursor will generate all the files and guide you
```

### Option B: Using ChatGPT / Claude

If you prefer a browser-based AI, you can copy the generated code manually.

```bash
# 1. Open ChatGPT or Claude in your browser
# 2. Paste the prompt template
# 3. The AI will generate code files — copy each one
# 4. Create the files in your project folder
# 5. Follow the AI's setup instructions
```

### Option C: Using GitHub Copilot in VS Code

```bash
# 1. Open VS Code with the GitHub Copilot extension
# 2. Open the Copilot Chat sidebar (Ctrl+Shift+I)
# 3. Paste the prompt template
# 4. Copilot will suggest file edits — accept them
```

## Before You Start

Make sure you have the NaaP development environment ready:

```bash
# Install Node.js 20+ from https://nodejs.org
node --version

# Install the NaaP CLI
npm install -g @naap/plugin-sdk

# Verify it works
naap-plugin --version
```

If you haven't set up the NaaP platform yet, see the [Quick Start](/docs/getting-started/quickstart) guide first.

## How the Prompts Are Structured

Every prompt template follows the same pattern:

1. **Context block** — Tells the AI about NaaP's architecture, so it generates compatible code
2. **Requirements** — Describes exactly what you want the plugin to do
3. **Technical specs** — Specifies the frameworks, file structure, and patterns to use
4. **Quality standards** — Ensures the AI generates production-quality code

You can customize any prompt by editing the **Requirements** section before pasting it.

## Tips for Best Results

- **Be specific** about what you want. If you have a specific feature idea, add it to the requirements section.
- **Iterate** — if the first result isn't perfect, tell the AI "change the UI to use a dark theme" or "add a search feature."
- **Ask for explanations** — if you don't understand something, ask the AI to explain what a piece of code does.
- **Test often** — run `naap-plugin dev` after each change to see your plugin in the shell.
- **Start simple** — use the Frontend-Only plugin template first. Add a backend later if needed.
